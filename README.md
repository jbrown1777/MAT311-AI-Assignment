Using AI for this assignment was really interesting. This was the first time I have used an AI to write code for me.
Usually, I just ask for syntax or clarifications. I can see many helpful side effects of using AI for program as well as many dangers.

If I had to write the code for this myself, it would have taken a long time. Claude 3 really sped things up for me.
Another benefit is that it summarizes it by saying what each variable is.
One example of this was it displayed what value was on each axes in the 3D model.

One danger of this assignment was that I didn't really learn what I copied. I just asked, copied, pasted, and then ran it.
I don't know how the solution worked.
I verified the code by comparing the code and the graphs it generated to the code/output of Dr. Mishra's code.
I knew to verify these because it is a visualization of the code.
